# A Practical Guide to Using `perf` on Linux

`perf` is a Linux performance analysis tool used to measure and profile the behavior of programs and systems. It can collect both high-level statistics and detailed sampling data, which makes it useful for performance tuning, debugging, and computer architecture analysis.

## What `perf` Can Help You Study

- CPU cycles
- Instructions retired
- Cache behavior
- Branch prediction behavior
- Function-level hotspots
- System-wide performance issues

## Environment on Our Server

On our server, `perf` has already been installed and can be used directly.

```bash
perf --version
```

> Note:
> Restricted access to kernel symbols or kernel profiling scope is normal on this server.
> For our benchmark work, this is not a problem. We only need to analyze the user-space benchmark code, so limited kernel-space visibility does not affect the main results.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
perf <subcommand> [options] [command]
```

## Common Subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `perf list` | Show available events |
| `perf stat` | Collect summary statistics |
| `perf record` | Record sampling data |
| `perf report` | Explore recorded samples |
| `perf top` | Show live hotspots |
| `perf annotate` | Inspect hot source lines or assembly |

## Listing Available Events

To see all events supported by your system:

```bash
perf list
```

This usually includes:

- Hardware events
- Software events
- Cache events
- Tracepoints
- Architecture-specific PMU events

Example:

```bash
perf list | less
```

## Using `perf stat`

`perf stat` provides summary statistics for a command.

Example:

```bash
perf stat ls
```

Common metrics include:

- `cycles`
- `instructions`
- `cache-references`
- `cache-misses`
- `branches`
- `branch-misses`
- `task-clock`
- `elapsed time`

Useful patterns:

```bash
# Measure a program
perf stat ./my_program [args...]

# Measure selected events
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses,branch-misses ./my_program [args...]

# Collect system-wide statistics for 5 seconds
perf stat -a sleep 5
```

If your benchmark takes command-line parameters, place them after `./my_program`. For example, `./my_program <input_size> <num_threads>`.

## Using `perf record`

`perf record` collects sampling data while a program runs.

Example:

```bash
perf record ./my_program [args...]
```

This creates a file named `perf.data`.

More useful variants:

```bash
# Record call graphs
perf record -g ./my_program [args...]

# Record a specific event
perf record -e cycles -g ./my_program [args...]
```

Call graphs are especially useful for understanding which call paths consume the most time.

## Using `perf report`

After recording data, use:

```bash
perf report
```

This opens an interactive report that shows:

- Hot functions
- Symbol names
- Shared libraries
- Sample percentages
- Call relationships

Typical workflow:

```bash
perf record -g ./my_program [args...]
perf report
```

## Profiling an Existing Process

If a process is already running, you can attach `perf` to it.

```bash
# Collect statistics from a running process
perf stat -p <pid> sleep 5

# Record samples from a running process
perf record -p <pid> -g sleep 10
```

Then view the results:

```bash
perf report
```

## Important Events

Some frequently used events are:

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `cycles` | Total CPU cycles |
| `instructions` | Total retired instructions |
| `cache-references` | Cache accesses |
| `cache-misses` | Cache misses |
| `branches` | Branch instructions |
| `branch-misses` | Branch mispredictions |
| `context-switches` | Context switch count |
| `page-faults` | Page fault count |
| `task-clock` | CPU time consumed |

Example:

```bash
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,branches,branch-misses ./my_program [args...]
```


## Cache Analysis

To study cache behavior:

```bash
perf stat -e cache-references,cache-misses ./my_program [args...]
```

A high cache miss rate may indicate:

- Poor locality
- Inefficient data layout
- Large working sets
- Memory-bound behavior

For more detailed analysis, use architecture-specific cache events from `perf list`.

## Branch Prediction Analysis

To analyze branch behavior:

```bash
perf stat -e branches,branch-misses ./my_program [args...]
```

A high branch miss rate may suggest:

- Unpredictable control flow
- Many conditional branches
- Poor branch locality

This is especially useful in performance-sensitive and architecture-focused work.

## Source and Assembly Annotation

To inspect which instructions or source lines are hot:

```bash
perf annotate
```

This can help you understand:

- Which instructions consume the most samples
- Whether the compiler generated efficient code
- Where bottlenecks appear in the instruction stream

You can also annotate a specific function:

```bash
perf annotate <function_name>
```

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Get overall statistics

```bash
perf stat ./my_program [args...]
```

The result would be like:

### 2. Measure key architecture-related metrics

```bash
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses,branch-misses ./my_program [args...]
```

![Example `perf stat -e ...` output](./src/res/image-1.png)

### 3. Record detailed samples

```bash
perf record -g -F 999 ./my_program [args...]
```

If `perf` reports limited access to kernel symbols or kernel profiling data here, that is expected on our server. We can continue and focus on user-space samples from the benchmark itself.

### 4. View hotspots

```bash
perf report
```

![Interactive `perf report` view](./src/res/image-5.png)

### 5. Drill down into a specific function

```bash
perf annotate --stdio --source -l -s <funcName>
```

Then it shows the location of hottest source code:

## Useful Tips

- Compile with `-g -fno-omit-frame-pointer` for better symbols
- Use realistic workloads
- Run tests multiple times to reduce noise
- Minimize background activity
- Use architecture-specific events when needed
